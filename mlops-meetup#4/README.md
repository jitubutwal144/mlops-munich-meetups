# Talk #1: 
- "Taking the Reigns of the Cloud: A Human-Centric Approach to ML Experiments" - A recurring challenge faced by many ML practitioners is moving from local experimentation to remote, scalable training. We argue that the main issues behind this challenge are the lack of a simple (human-centric) interface and the GPU shortage experienced by major cloud providers. In this talk, we first overview existing ways to run ML experiments in a cloud and highlight their limitations. After that, we design a simple interface for delegating an experiment directly from an IDE. Eventually, we discuss techniques that can mitigate the GPU shortage issue.

# Talk #2: 
- "Mastering LLMs in the Era of Evolving Trends" offers a deep dive into the dynamic world of Large Language Models (LLMs). We’ll start by exploring LLMOps, providing insights from the unique perspective of Weights & Biases. You’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of our strategies for staying ahead amidst the rapidly changing LLM landscape, and we’ll share our approach to enhancing our tools to keep pace with emerging trends. Additionally, we’ll shed light on how we cater to diverse LLM user personas, including LLM Creators, Fine-tuners, and Prompt Engineers, drawing from our extensive experience. Throughout the talk, we’ll unveil cutting-edge LLMOps capabilities designed to empower your mastery of LLMs in this evolving era.
